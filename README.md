## Avatar: The Last AirBender - Object-Oriented Programming Lab

### Preview

Dive into the world of Avatar: The Last AirBender
and learn Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) through elemental bending!
Create classes for Waterbending, Firebending, Earthbending, and Airbending,
each with unique abilities.
Your journey will involve mastering Python OOP concepts and
passing tests inspired by this beloved series.


### Learning Goals

- Create and instantiate classes in Python.
- Build methods that perform functions tailored to their unique objects.
- Use the `property()` function to create properties and validate input.
- Learn test-driven development,
and enhance your classes with creative features to master the art of OOP in the Avatar world.
- Get to know the big world of python.

### Your Journey

Your journey begins with coding challenges to create classes that embody these elements. Each class represents a different element and character. For example, you will craft a `WaterBender` class to encapsulate the abilities of a Water Bender like Katara.

TODO: Refactor this into a better exercise explanation.

### Your Quest

Your quest is to pass a series of tests that validate your mastery of Object-Oriented Programming.
These tests will evaluate your ability to create and instantiate classes, implement methods,
and ensure that your code behaves as expected.

The test-driven development approach will guide your journey. You'll start with failing tests and work your way through each challenge until all tests are successfully passed. Along the way, feel free to add your own creative features to enhance the experience.

Are you ready to embark on this exciting coding adventure in the world of Avatar: The Last Air Bender? Let's get started!

Happy coding, young Bender!
